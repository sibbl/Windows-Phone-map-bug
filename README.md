Windows Phone 8.1 MapControl bug
================================

This sample project shows a bug of the Windows Phone MapControl where polygons won't render if they overlap themselves. That means that holes in MapPolygons are impossible at the moment.
 
**Expected behavior:**
Two blue polylines and a red polygon with a hole in the middle are drawn.

**Actual behavior:**
Only two blue polylines are drawn.
